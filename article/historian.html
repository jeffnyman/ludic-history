      <h1>Acting Like a Historian</h1>

      <p>
        The role of history can be thought of as a tool for changing how we think, for promoting a literacy not just of names and dates but also of discernment, judgment, and caution. History teaches us a way to make choices, to balance opinions, to tell stories, and to become uneasy &mdash; when necessary &mdash; about the stories we tell.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Ambition</h2>

      <p>
        The accumulation of substantial knowledge in adulthood typically stems from discipline &mdash; a deliberate, sustained engagement of the mind over an extended duration, characterized by unwavering effort and, well, just sheer hard work. This endeavor is not solely an intellectual pursuit but, at least in my mind, equally a moral and ethical discipline. It involves a conscious choice to dedicate a portion of your life to a task that, while more challenging and initially perhaps less enjoyable, holds the promise of profound intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In essence, the pursuit of knowledge in adulthood is not just an intellectual quest; it's sort of like embarking on a pilgrimage. It entails a deliberate and purposeful journey, requiring commitment and perseverance. By making the conscious decision to invest time and effort into a challenging intellectual pursuit, I truly do believe that we partake in a moral and intellectual pilgrimage, a transformative journey that extends beyond the mere acquisition of facts to a deeper, more profound understanding of the world and, oddly enough, yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Approach</h2>

      <p>
        I have a deliberate approach to unraveling intricate subjects, constructing concepts methodically from their foundational elements. The challenge intensifies when these fundamental elements are tightly interwoven, a characteristic often shaped by either intentional design or the sheer passage of time, and occasionally, a blend of both. The enduring nature of certain elements leads to the gradual accumulation of design features over time, creating a complex tapestry much like a spider's web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find that as you delve into these topics, especially those crafted with intention and sustained through time, a revelation unfolds &mdash; the world is intricately woven together by a network of relationships. Each event and detail is intricately connected to another, forming the backbone of our understanding. It's akin to peering into a vast and elaborate tapestry where every thread is interlinked. The unfolding of time becomes a visible expression of the evolution and transformation within these relationships, highlighting the historical aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        While acknowledging that history itself might not possess a deliberate design, the patterns and interconnectedness we discern in its study can be likened to a form of design. It's the recognition that what we perceive as the historical narrative is a result of the relationships and threads that have woven themselves into the fabric of time.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Scope</h2>

      <p>
        My overall goal here is to present a historiography tracing the original sources for particular facts, any disagreements between the sources, and commentary on what I feel was the most likely sequence of events in certain aspects of gaming history, particularly related to ludonarrative aspects.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many topics, this will be a relatively straight-forward task of stitching together primary sources to tell a narrative; for other topics, however, this will involve sifting through ambiguous, at best, and contradictory, at worst, accounts and information.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do all that requires a certain approach to history and this page will talk about that approach. Front and center to this approach is having a historical consciousness. But what does <em>that</em> mean?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To possess a historical sense does not mean simply to possess information about the past. It means to have a different consciousness, a historical consciousness, to have incorporated into our minds a mode of understanding that profoundly influences the way we look at the world. History adds another dimension to our view of the world and enriches our experience. Someone with a historical sense sees reality differently.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from Gordon Wood in his book <em>The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having such a historical sensibility requires the historian to possess various characteristics. One of the most important of those is a toleration and even appreciation of uncertainty, surprise, and unintended consequences in the operative human context of the history being studied. This needs to be coupled to a comfort with indeterminacy and multi-causal explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another such sensibility is a recognition of "vertical history" and "horizontal history." The vertical context is about assessing the temporal &mdash; the short, medium, and long term &mdash; causes of an event and how those causes interact. The horizontal aspect looks at the spatial dimension of history, or how different issues are interconnected and related.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a sensibility that seems so obvious as to not require mention and yet it very much does. This is the sensibility that we <em>can</em>, in fact, discover much about the history we want to study.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Because contesting visions of the past have failed to create a comfortable consensus, and because change is the essence of historical experience, some critics have argued there can be no stable, knowable past. They have failed to understand that just because our definitions or descriptions change, does not mean that the phenomenon being described does not exist or cannot ultimately be known with some certainty.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from the book <em>Telling the Truth About History</em> by Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob. It's critical to believe that there is actually something "out there" that is discoverable through various chains of evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, I believe, gaining a true historical sense involves the capacity to perceive past actors in a holistic manner &mdash; to view them within the framework of their own era. It requires the ability to depict their limitations and errors with empathy, acknowledging the constraints they faced within the dynamic currents of their time. Understanding the past entails recognizing the participants' susceptibility to evolving circumstances beyond their control, and appreciating the unintended consequences that often arose from their actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To possess a historical sense is to grasp the intricacies of bygone eras and convey them without distorting the context with anachronistic lenses. It's sort of like if we wore temporal spectacles that allow us to witness the unfolding drama of history with a nuanced awareness of the actors' perspectives, challenges, and the unpredictable outcomes that sprang from their endeavors. In essence, it's about fostering a connection between our present and the past, bridging the temporal gap with a keen understanding that does justice to the complexities inherent in the human experience across time.
      </p>

      <h2>A Core Historical Approach</h2>

      <p>
        In the realm of historical analysis, historians commence their exploration with foundational assumptions, grounding their work in the retroactive acknowledgment of established principles, such as the laws of physics and the inherent biological traits of humans and animals. These assumptions serve as a scaffold for the historian's toolkit, encompassing deductive logic, inductive data collection methods, the application of statistical theory across time, and the demographically feasible.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this foundational point, historical inquiry takes on a forensic nature, resembling a meticulous court case where generalized theories hold little sway. The historian is tasked with scrutinizing not entire classes of events but singular, specific occurrences &mdash; deciding whether they plausibly occurred or not. In this pursuit, every conceivable piece of information is fair game, akin to a detective gathering evidence. The cardinal rule remains unbroken: no shortcuts. Each argument must be explicitly articulated, and its underlying assumptions must be laid bare, ensuring a rigorous and transparent approach to historical analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professional historians undertake three distinct endeavors. Firstly, they embark on the challenging task of approximating what "truly" transpired, cognizant of the inherent challenge that all historical narratives are essentially heuristic fictions. Acknowledging that achieving both a fully adequate description and absolute factual accuracy is often an elusive goal, historians navigate the complexities of representing the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, and perhaps more crucially, historians dedicate their efforts to exploring the perceptions of events held by people of the time. This aspect lies at the core of the discipline, encapsulating the essence of documenting the evolution of humanity's awareness of itself and its surroundings. In essence, historians delve into the development of collective consciousness over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thirdly, there are instances when historians scrutinize how particular elites, whether religious or secular, shaped the narrative by influencing what people were expected to believe about past events. The synergy of these three elements can provide a comprehensive understanding of the ebb and flow of historical events, shedding light on the interplay between objective occurrences, public perception, and the influence wielded by influential figures or institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more we delve into the past, the more intricacies and complexities we unearth. Historians, like skilled detectives, aim to fathom the depths of historical circumstances, unraveling the intricate web of events. It's akin to peeling back layers of time to expose a different world, one that demands a robust historical imagination for accurate reconstruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the hands of adept historians, the past transforms into a nuanced realm where understanding requires not only an appreciation of conscious human will and intentions but also an acknowledgment of the unseen forces at play. These forces, be they demographic shifts, economic tides, or overarching cultural trends, act as silent architects shaping the destinies of individuals and societies. The unfolding drama and occasional tragedy of history emerge from the delicate balance between human agency and the often unnoticed constraints imposed by these underlying conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's like witnessing a historical stage where actors, driven by their aspirations and motivations, perform against a backdrop of invisible but influential factors. The tension arises from the clash between what people strive for and the formidable currents that guide, or sometimes impede, their journey. It's a narrative where the protagonists, unaware of the full scope of the stage they tread, grapple with a reality both shaped by their choices and constrained by larger, unseen hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to capture the essence of historical complexity, where the past becomes a tapestry woven not just by the deliberate actions of individuals, but also by the intricate threads of broader, often imperceptible, historical forces.
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Scientific thinking is a type of knowledge seeking involving intentional information seeking, including asking questions, testing hypotheses, making observations, recognizing patterns, and making inferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scientific mind finds unparalleled fascination in the realms of the strange and unfamiliar. At the core of scientific thought lies the profound principle that an observed truth, even one that disrupts established understanding, is nonetheless the truth. When faced with an observation that withstands scrutiny, it signals not a crisis but an opportunity &mdash; an opportunity to refine and cultivate a more precise understanding of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        This doesn't imply a departure from scientific principles in favor of magic. Instead, it suggests a broader perspective where magic, in its own right, becomes a facet of the physical phenomena that influence our world. Scientific inquiry, after all, is a journey toward knowledge, one that necessitates the inclusion and explanation of every observable fact, without selective rejection. The open-minded scientist sees this not as a threat to their understanding but as a chance to expand the boundaries of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach, rooted in scientific thinking, resonates across various disciplines, including historical studies. The principle holds: to comprehend the intricate tapestry of history, one must embrace every observable fact, even if it challenges preconceived notions, in order to craft a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skepticism is not just a method of learning but a philosophical posture that has echoed since the times of the Greeks. It serves as a crucial element in the pursuit of truth, injecting a healthy dose of doubt into our assessments of truth claims. This skepticism acts as a catalyst, motivating individuals to delve deeper into understanding and maintaining an openness to the potential fallibility of their own beliefs. It's a constructive skepticism that fuels the ongoing quest for knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, we recognize that veering into complete skepticism can be counterproductive. When doubt becomes all-encompassing, it can cripple our ability to make informed judgments or draw meaningful conclusions. Instead of facilitating learning, it transforms into a hindrance, leaving us entangled in a web of paradoxes. The balanced application of skepticism, rooted in critical inquiry and a willingness to question, offers a pathway to enlightenment, whereas an absolute skepticism, devoid of discernment, leads down a road marked by perplexities with little clarity to be found.
      </p>

      <p>
        Relativism, a contemporary companion to skepticism, posits that truth is contingent upon the perspective of the individual making a statement. This notion has given rise to a pervasive sense of uncertainty regarding our capacity to ascertain truth and even to establish the existence of an objective truth. The embrace of relativism prompts a reevaluation of the ideal of objectivity, challenging the belief that individuals can transcend their subjective positions to uncover universal truths.
      </p>

      <p>
        When truth becomes dependent on the observer's standpoint, the very notion of transcendent, universal, or absolute truths comes into question. How can such truths exist if they are tethered to individual perspectives, each unique and influenced by various factors? Despite this, we argue that truths about the past remain within reach, acknowledging that they may not be absolute. While the relativistic lens challenges the concept of universal truths, it doesn't negate the value of striving for historical truths that, though shaped by diverse perspectives, contribute to our collective understanding across generations.
      </p>

      <h2>The Place of History</h2>

      <p>
        One thing to consider here is that I'm not investigating scientific aspects, by which I include a sole focus on technology. Rather, I'm looking at the products and producers of literature and art, of which games are very much a part. Those products and those producers can most certainly be studied in factual aspects and this is because they are outcomes of, and participants in, historical events.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's long been interesting to me is that the study of history is one of the borderlands &mdash; a sort of dimensional crossing &mdash; marching between scientific and non-scientific endeavors. And what sits at that border, or what gates the dimensions, is the idea of consensibility: the ability to form a consensus that can be more or less broadly accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a strong argument that for something to be "scientific" it must be amenable to a consensus of opinion. But does that mean that somethingt that's <em>not</em> so amenable is automatically "unscientific"? Let's consider something John Ziman wrote in his book <em>Public Knowledge: An Essay Concerning the Social Dimension of Science</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Suppose that we are investigating such a problem as the date and place of birth of a writer or statesman. We search in libraries and other collections of material documents for written evidence. From various oblique references we might build up an argument in favour of some particular hypothesis — an argument to persuade our colleagues by its invincible logic that no other interpretation is tenable.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here Ziman is, of course, talking about the work of a historian. He then continues:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        This procedure seems quite as scientific as the research of a palaeontologist, who might reconstruct the anatomy of an extinct animal by piecing together fragments of fossil bone.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The similarity here is the notion of providing a convincing case, ideally one which no reasonable person could refute. This case is predicated upon interrogable evidence. Evidence, in this context, refers to any information that is considered relevant to a proposed hypothesis. Any such hypothesis can be, and should be, stated in such a way that it's capable of being disputed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put another way, our hypotheses &mdash; for both the historian and the scientist &mdash; can be challenged by appeals for the evidence against them and promoted by the appeals for the evidence that support them. Thus, in both cases, there's a desire to clarify a path of implications through successive stages of investigation that will validate or refute some hypothesis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The credibility of the evidence clearly matters very much here and the notion of sufficient evidence hinges not just on how much of it there is &mdash; to corroborate the argument &mdash; but how credible it is. If we can't find such evidence, the intellectually honest thing to do is either abandon the hypothesis or at least concede that the matter is still uncertain and search for more evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I just said is what good scientists <em>and</em> historians do. But there's also what Ziman refers to as the "other mood in History" which he says is:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The attempt to understand human history imaginatively and to 'explain' it. Having ascertained the 'facts', the historian tries to uncover the hidden motives and forces at work, just as the scientist goes behind the phenomena to the laws of their being.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This, once again, seems to draw a point of similarity between the scientist and the historian. Yet a truism is that many events in history simply can't be explained entirely convincingly in the language of cause and effect such that there must, <em>by necessity</em>, be consensibility. What you often end with are various historical theories none of which, as would be the case for a valid scientific theory, would be so acceptable enough so as to eliminate all competing theories or to remove all reasonable doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider how this differs a bit for scientists. The range of discussion related to theories, and the experiments around them, tends to be limited to model systems whose mathematical properties are calculable and can be critically assessed by other researches and independently confirmed by them.
      </p>

      <p>
        History that only focused on what everyone could agree with would be largely trivial and uninteresting. History thus seeks to speak to other values and not just some notion of "scientific accuracy." And, as such, this means that the "theories" of history have different criteria around verfication and refutation. Speaking to this point, Ziman says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Whatever their reasons, historians do not agree on the general theoretical foundations or methodology of their studies. Instead of establishing, by mutual criticism and tacit cooperation, a limited common basis of acceptable theory, from which to build upwards and outwards, they often feel bound to set up antagonistic 'schools' of interpretation.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        These "schools of interpretation" tend to set up or at least reinforce an ecology. So let's dig into that next.
