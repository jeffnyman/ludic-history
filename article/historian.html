      <h1>Acting Like a Historian</h1>

      <p>
        The role of history can be thought of as a tool for changing how we think, for promoting a literacy not just of names and dates but also of discernment, judgment, and caution. History teaches us a way to make choices, to balance opinions, to tell stories, and to become uneasy &mdash; when necessary &mdash; about the stories we tell.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Ambition</h2>

      <p>
        The accumulation of substantial knowledge in adulthood typically stems from discipline &mdash; a deliberate, sustained engagement of the mind over an extended duration, characterized by unwavering effort and, well, just sheer hard work. This endeavor is not solely an intellectual pursuit but, at least in my mind, equally a moral and ethical discipline. It involves a conscious choice to dedicate a portion of your life to a task that, while more challenging and initially perhaps less enjoyable, holds the promise of profound intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In essence, the pursuit of knowledge in adulthood is not just an intellectual quest; it's sort of like embarking on a pilgrimage. It entails a deliberate and purposeful journey, requiring commitment and perseverance. By making the conscious decision to invest time and effort into a challenging intellectual pursuit, I truly do believe that we partake in a moral and intellectual pilgrimage, a transformative journey that extends beyond the mere acquisition of facts to a deeper, more profound understanding of the world and, oddly enough, yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Approach</h2>

      <p>
        I have a deliberate approach to unraveling intricate subjects, constructing concepts methodically from their foundational elements. The challenge intensifies when these fundamental elements are tightly interwoven, a characteristic often shaped by either intentional design or the sheer passage of time, and occasionally, a blend of both. The enduring nature of certain elements leads to the gradual accumulation of design features over time, creating a complex tapestry much like a spider's web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find that as you delve into these topics, especially those crafted with intention and sustained through time, a revelation unfolds &mdash; the world is intricately woven together by a network of relationships. Each event and detail is intricately connected to another, forming the backbone of our understanding. It's akin to peering into a vast and elaborate tapestry where every thread is interlinked. The unfolding of time becomes a visible expression of the evolution and transformation within these relationships, highlighting the historical aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        While acknowledging that history itself might not possess a deliberate design, the patterns and interconnectedness we discern in its study can be likened to a form of design. It's the recognition that what we perceive as the historical narrative is a result of the relationships and threads that have woven themselves into the fabric of time.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Scope</h2>

      <p>
        My overall goal here is to present a historiography tracing the original sources for particular facts, any disagreements between the sources, and commentary on what I feel was the most likely sequence of events in certain aspects of gaming history, particularly related to ludonarrative aspects.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many topics, this will be a relatively straight-forward task of stitching together primary sources to tell a narrative; for other topics, however, this will involve sifting through ambiguous, at best, and contradictory, at worst, accounts and information.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do all that requires a certain approach to history and this page will talk about that approach. Front and center to this approach is having a historical consciousness. But what does <em>that</em> mean?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To possess a historical sense does not mean simply to possess information about the past. It means to have a different consciousness, a historical consciousness, to have incorporated into our minds a mode of understanding that profoundly influences the way we look at the world. History adds another dimension to our view of the world and enriches our experience. Someone with a historical sense sees reality differently.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from Gordon Wood in his book <em>The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having such a historical sensibility requires the historian to possess various characteristics. One of the most important of those is a toleration and even appreciation of uncertainty, surprise, and unintended consequences in the operative human context of the history being studied. This needs to be coupled to a comfort with indeterminacy and multi-causal explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another such sensibility is a recognition of "vertical history" and "horizontal history." The vertical context is about assessing the temporal &mdash; the short, medium, and long term &mdash; causes of an event and how those causes interact. The horizontal aspect looks at the spatial dimension of history, or how different issues are interconnected and related.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a sensibility that seems so obvious as to not require mention and yet it very much does. This is the sensibility that we <em>can</em>, in fact, discover much about the history we want to study.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Because contesting visions of the past have failed to create a comfortable consensus, and because change is the essence of historical experience, some critics have argued there can be no stable, knowable past. They have failed to understand that just because our definitions or descriptions change, does not mean that the phenomenon being described does not exist or cannot ultimately be known with some certainty.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from the book <em>Telling the Truth About History</em> by Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob. It's critical to believe that there is actually something "out there" that is discoverable through various chains of evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, I believe, gaining a true historical sense involves the capacity to perceive past actors in a holistic manner &mdash; to view them within the framework of their own era. It requires the ability to depict their limitations and errors with empathy, acknowledging the constraints they faced within the dynamic currents of their time. Understanding the past entails recognizing the participants' susceptibility to evolving circumstances beyond their control, and appreciating the unintended consequences that often arose from their actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To possess a historical sense is to grasp the intricacies of bygone eras and convey them without distorting the context with anachronistic lenses. It's sort of like if we wore temporal spectacles that allow us to witness the unfolding drama of history with a nuanced awareness of the actors' perspectives, challenges, and the unpredictable outcomes that sprang from their endeavors. In essence, it's about fostering a connection between our present and the past, bridging the temporal gap with a keen understanding that does justice to the complexities inherent in the human experience across time.
      </p>

      <h2>A Core Historical Approach</h2>

      <p>
        In the realm of historical analysis, historians commence their exploration with foundational assumptions, grounding their work in the retroactive acknowledgment of established principles, such as the laws of physics and the inherent biological traits of humans and animals. These assumptions serve as a scaffold for the historian's toolkit, encompassing deductive logic, inductive data collection methods, the application of statistical theory across time, and the demographically feasible.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this foundational point, historical inquiry takes on a forensic nature, resembling a meticulous court case where generalized theories hold little sway. The historian is tasked with scrutinizing not entire classes of events but singular, specific occurrences &mdash; deciding whether they plausibly occurred or not. In this pursuit, every conceivable piece of information is fair game, akin to a detective gathering evidence. The cardinal rule remains unbroken: no shortcuts. Each argument must be explicitly articulated, and its underlying assumptions must be laid bare, ensuring a rigorous and transparent approach to historical analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professional historians undertake three distinct endeavors. Firstly, they embark on the challenging task of approximating what "truly" transpired, cognizant of the inherent challenge that all historical narratives are essentially heuristic fictions. Acknowledging that achieving both a fully adequate description and absolute factual accuracy is often an elusive goal, historians navigate the complexities of representing the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, and perhaps more crucially, historians dedicate their efforts to exploring the perceptions of events held by people of the time. This aspect lies at the core of the discipline, encapsulating the essence of documenting the evolution of humanity's awareness of itself and its surroundings. In essence, historians delve into the development of collective consciousness over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thirdly, there are instances when historians scrutinize how particular elites, whether religious or secular, shaped the narrative by influencing what people were expected to believe about past events. The synergy of these three elements can provide a comprehensive understanding of the ebb and flow of historical events, shedding light on the interplay between objective occurrences, public perception, and the influence wielded by influential figures or institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more we delve into the past, the more intricacies and complexities we unearth. Historians, like skilled detectives, aim to fathom the depths of historical circumstances, unraveling the intricate web of events. It's akin to peeling back layers of time to expose a different world, one that demands a robust historical imagination for accurate reconstruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the hands of adept historians, the past transforms into a nuanced realm where understanding requires not only an appreciation of conscious human will and intentions but also an acknowledgment of the unseen forces at play. These forces, be they demographic shifts, economic tides, or overarching cultural trends, act as silent architects shaping the destinies of individuals and societies. The unfolding drama and occasional tragedy of history emerge from the delicate balance between human agency and the often unnoticed constraints imposed by these underlying conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's like witnessing a historical stage where actors, driven by their aspirations and motivations, perform against a backdrop of invisible but influential factors. The tension arises from the clash between what people strive for and the formidable currents that guide, or sometimes impede, their journey. It's a narrative where the protagonists, unaware of the full scope of the stage they tread, grapple with a reality both shaped by their choices and constrained by larger, unseen hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to capture the essence of historical complexity, where the past becomes a tapestry woven not just by the deliberate actions of individuals, but also by the intricate threads of broader, often imperceptible, historical forces.
