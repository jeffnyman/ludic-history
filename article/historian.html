      <h1>Acting Like a Historian</h1>

      <p>
        The role of history can be thought of as a tool for changing how we think, for promoting a literacy not just of names and dates but also of discernment, judgment, and caution. History teaches us a way to make choices, to balance opinions, to tell stories, and to become uneasy &mdash; when necessary &mdash; about the stories we tell.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Ambition</h2>

      <p>
        The accumulation of substantial knowledge in adulthood typically stems from discipline &mdash; a deliberate, sustained engagement of the mind over an extended duration, characterized by unwavering effort and, well, just sheer hard work. This endeavor is not solely an intellectual pursuit but, at least in my mind, equally a moral and ethical discipline. It involves a conscious choice to dedicate a portion of your life to a task that, while more challenging and initially perhaps less enjoyable, holds the promise of profound intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In essence, the pursuit of knowledge in adulthood is not just an intellectual quest; it's sort of like embarking on a pilgrimage. It entails a deliberate and purposeful journey, requiring commitment and perseverance. By making the conscious decision to invest time and effort into a challenging intellectual pursuit, I truly do believe that we partake in a moral and intellectual pilgrimage, a transformative journey that extends beyond the mere acquisition of facts to a deeper, more profound understanding of the world and, oddly enough, yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Approach</h2>

      <p>
        I have a deliberate approach to unraveling intricate subjects, constructing concepts methodically from their foundational elements. The challenge intensifies when these fundamental elements are tightly interwoven, a characteristic often shaped by either intentional design or the sheer passage of time, and occasionally, a blend of both. The enduring nature of certain elements leads to the gradual accumulation of design features over time, creating a complex tapestry much like a spider's web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find that as you delve into these topics, especially those crafted with intention and sustained through time, a revelation unfolds &mdash; the world is intricately woven together by a network of relationships. Each event and detail is intricately connected to another, forming the backbone of our understanding. It's akin to peering into a vast and elaborate tapestry where every thread is interlinked. The unfolding of time becomes a visible expression of the evolution and transformation within these relationships, highlighting the historical aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        While acknowledging that history itself might not possess a deliberate design, the patterns and interconnectedness we discern in its study can be likened to a form of design. It's the recognition that what we perceive as the historical narrative is a result of the relationships and threads that have woven themselves into the fabric of time.
      </p>

      <h2>The Broad Scope</h2>

      <p>
        My overall goal here is to present a historiography tracing the original sources for particular facts, any disagreements between the sources, and commentary on what I feel was the most likely sequence of events in certain aspects of gaming history, particularly related to ludonarrative aspects.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many topics, this will be a relatively straight-forward task of stitching together primary sources to tell a narrative; for other topics, however, this will involve sifting through ambiguous, at best, and contradictory, at worst, accounts and information.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do all that requires a certain approach to history and this page will talk about that approach. Front and center to this approach is having a historical consciousness. But what does <em>that</em> mean?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To possess a historical sense does not mean simply to possess information about the past. It means to have a different consciousness, a historical consciousness, to have incorporated into our minds a mode of understanding that profoundly influences the way we look at the world. History adds another dimension to our view of the world and enriches our experience. Someone with a historical sense sees reality differently.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from Gordon Wood in his book <em>The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having such a historical sensibility requires the historian to possess various characteristics. One of the most important of those is a toleration and even appreciation of uncertainty, surprise, and unintended consequences in the operative human context of the history being studied. This needs to be coupled to a comfort with indeterminacy and multi-causal explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another such sensibility is a recognition of "vertical history" and "horizontal history." The vertical context is about assessing the temporal &mdash; the short, medium, and long term &mdash; causes of an event and how those causes interact. The horizontal aspect looks at the spatial dimension of history, or how different issues are interconnected and related.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a sensibility that seems so obvious as to not require mention and yet it very much does. This is the sensibility that we <em>can</em>, in fact, discover much about the history we want to study.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Because contesting visions of the past have failed to create a comfortable consensus, and because change is the essence of historical experience, some critics have argued there can be no stable, knowable past. They have failed to understand that just because our definitions or descriptions change, does not mean that the phenomenon being described does not exist or cannot ultimately be known with some certainty.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That comes from the book <em>Telling the Truth About History</em> by Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob. It's critical to believe that there is actually something "out there" that is discoverable through various chains of evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, I believe, gaining a true historical sense involves the capacity to perceive past actors in a holistic manner &mdash; to view them within the framework of their own era. It requires the ability to depict their limitations and errors with empathy, acknowledging the constraints they faced within the dynamic currents of their time. Understanding the past entails recognizing the participants' susceptibility to evolving circumstances beyond their control, and appreciating the unintended consequences that often arose from their actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To possess a historical sense is to grasp the intricacies of bygone eras and convey them without distorting the context with anachronistic lenses. It's sort of like if we wore temporal spectacles that allow us to witness the unfolding drama of history with a nuanced awareness of the actors' perspectives, challenges, and the unpredictable outcomes that sprang from their endeavors. In essence, it's about fostering a connection between our present and the past, bridging the temporal gap with a keen understanding that does justice to the complexities inherent in the human experience across time.
      </p>

      <h2>A Core Historical Approach</h2>

      <p>
        In the realm of historical analysis, historians commence their exploration with foundational assumptions, grounding their work in the retroactive acknowledgment of established principles, such as the laws of physics and the inherent biological traits of humans and animals. These assumptions serve as a scaffold for the historian's toolkit, encompassing deductive logic, inductive data collection methods, the application of statistical theory across time, and the demographically feasible.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this foundational point, historical inquiry takes on a forensic nature, resembling a meticulous court case where generalized theories hold little sway. The historian is tasked with scrutinizing not entire classes of events but singular, specific occurrences &mdash; deciding whether they plausibly occurred or not. In this pursuit, every conceivable piece of information is fair game, akin to a detective gathering evidence. The cardinal rule remains unbroken: no shortcuts. Each argument must be explicitly articulated, and its underlying assumptions must be laid bare, ensuring a rigorous and transparent approach to historical analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professional historians undertake three distinct endeavors. Firstly, they embark on the challenging task of approximating what "truly" transpired, cognizant of the inherent challenge that all historical narratives are essentially heuristic fictions. Acknowledging that achieving both a fully adequate description and absolute factual accuracy is often an elusive goal, historians navigate the complexities of representing the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, and perhaps more crucially, historians dedicate their efforts to exploring the perceptions of events held by people of the time. This aspect lies at the core of the discipline, encapsulating the essence of documenting the evolution of humanity's awareness of itself and its surroundings. In essence, historians delve into the development of collective consciousness over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thirdly, there are instances when historians scrutinize how particular elites, whether religious or secular, shaped the narrative by influencing what people were expected to believe about past events. The synergy of these three elements can provide a comprehensive understanding of the ebb and flow of historical events, shedding light on the interplay between objective occurrences, public perception, and the influence wielded by influential figures or institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more we delve into the past, the more intricacies and complexities we unearth. Historians, like skilled detectives, aim to fathom the depths of historical circumstances, unraveling the intricate web of events. It's akin to peeling back layers of time to expose a different world, one that demands a robust historical imagination for accurate reconstruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the hands of adept historians, the past transforms into a nuanced realm where understanding requires not only an appreciation of conscious human will and intentions but also an acknowledgment of the unseen forces at play. These forces, be they demographic shifts, economic tides, or overarching cultural trends, act as silent architects shaping the destinies of individuals and societies. The unfolding drama and occasional tragedy of history emerge from the delicate balance between human agency and the often unnoticed constraints imposed by these underlying conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's like witnessing a historical stage where actors, driven by their aspirations and motivations, perform against a backdrop of invisible but influential factors. The tension arises from the clash between what people strive for and the formidable currents that guide, or sometimes impede, their journey. It's a narrative where the protagonists, unaware of the full scope of the stage they tread, grapple with a reality both shaped by their choices and constrained by larger, unseen hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to capture the essence of historical complexity, where the past becomes a tapestry woven not just by the deliberate actions of individuals, but also by the intricate threads of broader, often imperceptible, historical forces.
      </p>

      <h2>Scientific Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Scientific thinking is a type of knowledge seeking involving intentional information seeking, including asking questions, testing hypotheses, making observations, recognizing patterns, and making inferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scientific mind finds unparalleled fascination in the realms of the strange and unfamiliar. At the core of scientific thought lies the profound principle that an observed truth, even one that disrupts established understanding, is nonetheless the truth. When faced with an observation that withstands scrutiny, it signals not a crisis but an opportunity &mdash; an opportunity to refine and cultivate a more precise understanding of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        This doesn't imply a departure from scientific principles in favor of magic. Instead, it suggests a broader perspective where magic, in its own right, becomes a facet of the physical phenomena that influence our world. Scientific inquiry, after all, is a journey toward knowledge, one that necessitates the inclusion and explanation of every observable fact, without selective rejection. The open-minded scientist sees this not as a threat to their understanding but as a chance to expand the boundaries of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach, rooted in scientific thinking, resonates across various disciplines, including historical studies. The principle holds: to comprehend the intricate tapestry of history, one must embrace every observable fact, even if it challenges preconceived notions, in order to craft a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skepticism is not just a method of learning but a philosophical posture that has echoed since the times of the Greeks. It serves as a crucial element in the pursuit of truth, injecting a healthy dose of doubt into our assessments of truth claims. This skepticism acts as a catalyst, motivating individuals to delve deeper into understanding and maintaining an openness to the potential fallibility of their own beliefs. It's a constructive skepticism that fuels the ongoing quest for knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, we recognize that veering into complete skepticism can be counterproductive. When doubt becomes all-encompassing, it can cripple our ability to make informed judgments or draw meaningful conclusions. Instead of facilitating learning, it transforms into a hindrance, leaving us entangled in a web of paradoxes. The balanced application of skepticism, rooted in critical inquiry and a willingness to question, offers a pathway to enlightenment, whereas an absolute skepticism, devoid of discernment, leads down a road marked by perplexities with little clarity to be found.
      </p>

      <p>
        Relativism, a contemporary companion to skepticism, posits that truth is contingent upon the perspective of the individual making a statement. This notion has given rise to a pervasive sense of uncertainty regarding our capacity to ascertain truth and even to establish the existence of an objective truth. The embrace of relativism prompts a reevaluation of the ideal of objectivity, challenging the belief that individuals can transcend their subjective positions to uncover universal truths.
      </p>

      <p>
        When truth becomes dependent on the observer's standpoint, the very notion of transcendent, universal, or absolute truths comes into question. How can such truths exist if they are tethered to individual perspectives, each unique and influenced by various factors? Despite this, we argue that truths about the past remain within reach, acknowledging that they may not be absolute. While the relativistic lens challenges the concept of universal truths, it doesn't negate the value of striving for historical truths that, though shaped by diverse perspectives, contribute to our collective understanding across generations.
      </p>

      <h2>The Place of History</h2>

      <p>
        One thing to consider here is that I'm not investigating scientific aspects, by which I include a sole focus on technology. Rather, I'm looking at the products and producers of literature and art, of which games are very much a part. Those products and those producers can most certainly be studied in factual aspects and this is because they are outcomes of, and participants in, historical events.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's long been interesting to me is that the study of history is one of the borderlands &mdash; a sort of dimensional crossing &mdash; marching between scientific and non-scientific endeavors. And what sits at that border, or what gates the dimensions, is the idea of consensibility: the ability to form a consensus that can be more or less broadly accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a strong argument that for something to be "scientific" it must be amenable to a consensus of opinion. But does that mean that somethingt that's <em>not</em> so amenable is automatically "unscientific"? Let's consider something John Ziman wrote in his book <em>Public Knowledge: An Essay Concerning the Social Dimension of Science</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Suppose that we are investigating such a problem as the date and place of birth of a writer or statesman. We search in libraries and other collections of material documents for written evidence. From various oblique references we might build up an argument in favour of some particular hypothesis — an argument to persuade our colleagues by its invincible logic that no other interpretation is tenable.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Here Ziman is, of course, talking about the work of a historian. He then continues:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        This procedure seems quite as scientific as the research of a palaeontologist, who might reconstruct the anatomy of an extinct animal by piecing together fragments of fossil bone.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The similarity here is the notion of providing a convincing case, ideally one which no reasonable person could refute. This case is predicated upon interrogable evidence. Evidence, in this context, refers to any information that is considered relevant to a proposed hypothesis. Any such hypothesis can be, and should be, stated in such a way that it's capable of being disputed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put another way, our hypotheses &mdash; for both the historian and the scientist &mdash; can be challenged by appeals for the evidence against them and promoted by the appeals for the evidence that support them. Thus, in both cases, there's a desire to clarify a path of implications through successive stages of investigation that will validate or refute some hypothesis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The credibility of the evidence clearly matters very much here and the notion of sufficient evidence hinges not just on how much of it there is &mdash; to corroborate the argument &mdash; but how credible it is. If we can't find such evidence, the intellectually honest thing to do is either abandon the hypothesis or at least concede that the matter is still uncertain and search for more evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I just said is what good scientists <em>and</em> historians do. But there's also what Ziman refers to as the "other mood in History" which he says is:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The attempt to understand human history imaginatively and to 'explain' it. Having ascertained the 'facts', the historian tries to uncover the hidden motives and forces at work, just as the scientist goes behind the phenomena to the laws of their being.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This, once again, seems to draw a point of similarity between the scientist and the historian. Yet a truism is that many events in history simply can't be explained entirely convincingly in the language of cause and effect such that there must, <em>by necessity</em>, be consensibility. What you often end with are various historical theories none of which, as would be the case for a valid scientific theory, would be so acceptable enough so as to eliminate all competing theories or to remove all reasonable doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider how this differs a bit for scientists. The range of discussion related to theories, and the experiments around them, tends to be limited to model systems whose mathematical properties are calculable and can be critically assessed by other researches and independently confirmed by them.
      </p>

      <p>
        History that only focused on what everyone could agree with would be largely trivial and uninteresting. History thus seeks to speak to other values and not just some notion of "scientific accuracy." And, as such, this means that the "theories" of history have different criteria around verfication and refutation. Speaking to this point, Ziman says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Whatever their reasons, historians do not agree on the general theoretical foundations or methodology of their studies. Instead of establishing, by mutual criticism and tacit cooperation, a limited common basis of acceptable theory, from which to build upwards and outwards, they often feel bound to set up antagonistic 'schools' of interpretation.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        These "schools of interpretation" tend to set up or at least reinforce an ecology. So let's dig into that next.
      </p>

      <h2>An Ecological View</h2>

      <p>
        One of my insights into studying how to be a historian has been the following: move from the reductionist into the ecological. Explaining that requires unpacking a few things.
      </p>

      <p>
        How we learn &mdash; and by "we" I mean all of us &mdash; is, to a very large extent, based on what things have in common. We quite literally depend on metaphor, on the recognition of patterns, on the recognition that something is "like" something else. And then we exploit that recognition to give ourselves more insights.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realize that what might seem out of place in that list is the idea of metaphor. Yet, on that very idea, consider the words of Aristotle in his <em>On the Art of Poetry</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        A good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        John Ziman's <em>Reliable Knowledge: An Exploration of the Grounds for Belief in Science</em> has him pointing out that scientific insights often arise from just such realizations.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The behavior of an electron in an atom is 'like' the vibration of air in a spherical container ... the random configuration of the long chain of atoms in a polymer molecule is 'like' the motion of a drunkard across a village green.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        All of this led me to the understanding that there's the reductionist view of reality and the ecological view of reality. A lot of work you'll come across in the historical field is of the reductionist sort. The reductionist viewpoint is the belief that you can understand reality by breaking it up into its various parts. John Lewis Gaddis, in his book <em>The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past</em>, says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It's critical to reductionism that causes be ranked hierarchically. To invoke a democracy of causes &mdash; to suggest that an event may have had many antecedents &mdash; is considered to be, well, mushy.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        True enough and people often don't like that "mushy" view. Thus people often turn to reductionism as a means of control. As Eelco Runia put it in <em>Moved by the Past: Discontinuity and Historical Mutation</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The discipline [of history] puts a premium on "sorting things out," and [thus] consequently the history departments spit out specialists in <em>organizing</em> things who have somehow lost the capacity to tolerate messiness.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        How I would phrase this is that, in this reductionist view applied to history, we're removing the "messiness" and the "mushy" bits and thus we're getting a bit of a sanitized view. That view removes some of the jagged edges of history and those jagged edges are often where uncertainty exists. In terms of motivation for a reductionist historical context, it seems that we feel like we're gaining some "understanding" of the "true history" by imposing controls on how that history <em>must</em> have played out.
      </p>

      <p>
        An ecological reality, on the other hand, is one where you recognize that it's often difficult to break things up into their component bits because so much depends upon so much else. Again, quoting Gaddis:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        For while the ecological approach also values the specification of simple components, it does not stop with that: it considers how components interact to become systems whose nature can't be defined merely by calculating the sum of their parts.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Speaking somewhat to this same point, Clayton Roberts, in his book <em>The Logic of Historical Explanation</em>, makes a lot of good points about the overall ecological view in history.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, we tend to attach much greater importance to the fact that President Harry Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders. It's a bit of a harsh example but that's also what drives home the relevance of the point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another more recent example might be the 6 January 2022 insurrection at the United States capitol. Accounts have generally had much to say about how Donald Trump may have instigated certain people to take the actions they took, such as storming the building, but those accounts often have less to say about why people made their own volitional choices to take those actions, regardless of whether they were being incited to do so.
      </p>

      <h2>Ecological Views Lead to Unification</h2>

      <p>
        An important point is that ecological views lead to unification. This requires taking a bit of a deep dive into how that manifests, particularly in the sciences.
      </p>

      <h3>The Basic Idea of Unification</h3>

      <p>
        The general concept of unification is fairly simple. If we have two theories that explain two apparently different behaviors of whatever it is we're studying, it's sometimes possible to replace both of those theories with a single theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is considered useful <em>if</em> that resulting single theory still manages to explain the different behaviors. Being able to do that is largely what's meant by unification. It may seem counterintuitive but it's generally the case that the resulting "unified theory" will be simpler than either of the previous two theories. The reason for this &mdash; at least in many cases &mdash; is because the unified theory is revealing a deeper, underlying truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I alluded to, it's easier to draw this point home with the sciences rather than history. There's a valid pedagogical point to doing this, however, because many have tried to state that the practice of history <em>is</em> a science. I'll come back to that point and how it relates to some of these examples.
      </p>

      <h3>Some Examples of Unifiers</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Consider Galileo Galilei.</strong> Around 1638, he realized that constant velocity was an underlying truth. Assuming such constant velocity, there was no experiment you could perform that would tell you whether you were moving or standing still. This essentially unified the ideas of "moving" and "stationary."
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Consider Isaac Newton.</strong> Around 1665, he wondered if the force that kept the Moon in orbit around the Earth (and the planets around the Sun) was the same force that tugged at objects on the Earth, drawing them toward the ground, such as an apple falling out of a tree. This unification &mdash; of the forces of celestial mechanics and earthly mechanics &mdash; led to the formulation of a specific force called gravity. This made people realize we can treat the events in space with the same mechanics that we do events on Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Consider Michael Faraday.</strong> Around 1831, he showed that if you push a magnet through a coil of wire, an electric current flows. Similarly, if you pass an electric current through a wire it can deflect a nearby magnetic compass. The idea was that electric currents create magnetic fields and moving magnetic fields create electric currents. This was electromagnetism, effectively unifying electricity and magnetism.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Consider James Clerk Maxwell.</strong> Around 1885, he refined Faraday's work showing that an electric field would generate a magnetic field and, conversely, a magnetic field would generate an electric field. Maxwell specifically showed that these fields would reinforce each other in an oscillatory manner. Thus was the idea of a self-sustaining electromagnetic wave conceived. This was a wave that traveled through space. Since this wave traveled, it had a speed. When that speed was calculated, Maxwell found it was the same as the speed of light. This meant that light was a form of electromagnetic wave. The unification here was the field of optics (light) with that of the previous unification, electromagnetism.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Consider Albert Einstein.</strong> Around 1905, he combined Maxwell's results with Newton's laws. This showed that the speed of light did not depend on the motion of an observer moving relative to the light. Einstein showed that you could combine the law of motion of Maxwell with the laws of motion of Newton &mdash; if, that is, you were willing to consider space and time to be dynamic properties of the universe. This idea unified not just electromagnetism with mechanics but also space with time. As a side-benefit, this also unified the concept of mass with energy.
      </p>

      <h3>Unifications Show the Wider Ecology</h3>

      <p>
        What you might notice with the above list of unifications is that everything sort of builds on everything else. Later unifications don't throw away what came before; rather, they incorporate it. That iterative inclusion of previous unifications leads to a series of relations between concepts and <em>that</em> is what makes everything ecological in nature. Let's keep digging a bit to drive home this point.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1916, Einstein pulled a Galileo. Galileo specifically talked about <em>constant motion</em> and that an object experiencing no forces will stay in its state of motion, where zero motion (or stationary) was just a constant motion of zero. Well, Einstein used that same idea and said that the force experienced by an observer undergoing <em>constant acceleration</em> was indistinguishable from the force of gravity that Newton talked about. So gravity and accelerated motion were unified.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it even got a bit more interesting. It turns out that if objects were in free-fall they would not feel any force of gravity at all. But this meant that gravity didn't exist as a "force" in its own right; rather, gravity was the curvature of space. Objects traveling in a straight line in a curved space would appear to be drawn towards the center of curvature. This motion of being drawn along lines of curvature can thus be interpreted as the force of gravity.
      </p>

      <p>
        So here the unification was the notion of gravity with the geometry of space itself. And since time was already linked with space, via previous unifications, this meant gravity &mdash; or, rather, curvature &mdash; could impact time as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        So one thing to notice here is that as we keep going along these lines of thinking, the unifications get a little less intuitive, a little harder to reason about. But they're all critically important. In fact, I want to come back to Einstein's specific work in a bit but, for now, let's consider one more stop here which will certainly reinforce the "less intuitive" point.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 1960s, when the study of particle physics was really heating up, there was a perceived symmetry between the particle associated with electromagnetism (the photon) and the previously theorized-about nuclear force. When finally discovered, the particles associated with the latter force were given the odd names W+, W-, and Z. The idea was that all four particles would be massless &mdash; thus all symmetrical &mdash; at high energies. But as the energy steadily decreased, this symmetry would be broken and the particles would take on different values and thus be discrete things.
      </p>

      <p>
        As it turned out, the photon was left with a mass value of zero but the W+, W-, and Z particles all ended up with some non-zero mass value. What this meant was that this nuclear force could only operate at short ranges. In fact, it's called the "<em>weak</em> nuclear force" for that reason. Whereas massless photons, as part of the electromagnetic force, can carry light across the entire universe and thus their range is obviously quite long.
      </p>

      <p>
        The point here is that the two forces of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force were, in fact, the <em>same force</em> behaving in two very different ways at the low energies that we human beings are mainly aware of and can experience. But if we have a realm that is sufficiently energetic enough, and thus hot enough, the electromagnetic force and the weak force would merge into a single force. This force was eventually proven to exist in the 1980s and was called the electroweak force.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, notice how even this one more leap up the unification chain took us into even greater realms of complexity. In fact, it took a good amount of effort to even recognize the unification, much less reason about it. Yet this greater complexity is actually about a concept that's providing <em>more</em> simplicity for the overall picture. Dealing with <em>that</em> particular balance takes good practitioners of a discipline.
      </p>

      <h2>Finding "Is Like" Takes Good Practitioners</h2>

      <p>
        What happens in all of the above cases is the use of imagination in terms of saying how something might be "like" something else; as in, "Hey, maybe it's the case that accelerated motion <em>is like</em> gravity." Unification, which is a refined form of saying what something "is like," requires having a certain amount of intuition that you harness to gather insight. In this context, I think it's important to note something that Andrew Thomas says in his book <em>Hidden in Plain Sight</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The ideas by which unification is achieved are generally extremely simple ideas &mdash; anyone understands these ideas. In fact, we could say that any unifying idea has to be simple.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Speaking in the context of the examples I provided above, Andrew says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It was as if these great unifiers picked up on something which was under our noses all the time, something which was missed perhaps because it was too simple. Something hidden in plain sight.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        How does this relate to the historical focus that I'm mainly concentrating on?
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't so much believe that history holds much that is "hidden in plain sight" necessarily but I do think the unification concept, and thus the ecological thinking that leads to it, allows us to hone our skills in ideas like deriving processes (what happens in history) from structures (what history leaves us to investigate), fitting representations (a way of viewing what happened in history) to realities (what actually happened in history), as well as learning to privilege neither induction nor deduction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, on that last point, I think <em>abductive reasoning</em> is a large part of what we seek. Thus I believe that historical reasoning is not just about confirmation or falsification, as in the sciences, but rather about <em>implausification</em>. I think it's worth considering the words of Sabine Hossenfelder in her excellent book <em>Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        What I learn, however, is that Karl Popper's idea that scientific theories must be falsifiable has long been an outdated philosophy. I am glad to hear this, as it's a philosophy that nobody in science ever could have used, other than as a rhetorical device. It is rarely possible to actually falsify an idea, since ideas can always be modified or extended to match incoming evidence.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Sabine expands on this point a bit when talking about our ideas in general:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        We "implausify" them: a continuously adapted theory becomes increasingly difficult and arcane &mdash; not to say ugly &mdash; and eventually practitioners lose interest. How much it takes to implausify an idea, however, depends on one's tolerance for repeatedly making a theory fit conflicting evidence.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I think this idea of "ugly" here can fit in well with the ideas of "mushy" and "messiness" from earlier. Beyond that, if there's one thing history often does, it presents us with conflicting evidence. And if there's one thing some people do when studying history, it's try to make some pre-existing theory fit with the evidence they are finding. Or, perhaps put a better way, they make the pre-existing theory fit only with those things they consider to be evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I should note that those things that they consider to be evidence often are subject to a confirmation bias, by which I mean people will tend to find evidence that the can interpret in such a way to support an already existing belief.
      </p>

      <p>
        A consequence of this is that people are often led to a selective bias in the evidence that they accept which, in turn, leads to a compromised view of standards of evidence. And, looked at in that way, certainly we can say that history "is like" science.
      </p>

      <h2>Does History Become Scientific?</h2>

      <p>
        Previously I said that "many have tried to state that history is a science" and it's worth perhaps exploring that a bit, particularly given that I just spent a whole lot of time talking about scientific ideas. But then I ended, quite deliberately, by saying that history <em>is like</em> science, as opposed to saying history <em>is</em> science. It's worth asking if there's a spectrum between "is like" and "is" in the ecological view.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tom Griffiths, in his book <em>The Art of Time Travel: Historians and Their Craft</em>, has a good take on where scientists and historians align:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        After the development of Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915, it became meaningless to talk about space and time as absolute, as transcending the limits of the universe; instead, they became dynamic qualities of the universe itself. In effect, the universe became finite and historical; it was no longer unchanging but had a beginning and an end &mdash; a life. Without absolute time, each individual has their own personal measure of time that depends on where they are and how they are moving. Physicists and historians agree on this.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Indeed they do agree on this. Time and place are the cornerstones of history. History requires a setting, a place, in which events take place. Events, of course, are structures of time. And structures persisting in time are what dictate chronology and causation.
      </p>

      <p>
        So here the humanities, in the form of history, and the sciences agree. Does that mean they are in alignment? Does that mean "is like" has shifted to "is"?
      </p>

      <p>
        Here it's worth pointing out that established historians like Marc Bloch, E.H. Carr, Donald Akenson, John Gaddis, Keith Hancock, and John Fea have all recognized that the idea of the humanities in general, and history in particular, becoming "scientific" was an enterprise that was tried and has effectively failed.
      </p>

      <p>
        History, inherently, has more subjective elements than objective. And while history can teach us lessons about what <em>might</em> happen, based on the past, it would be hubris to suggest that it's predictive about human cultural and social changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subjectivity and contingency are critical aspects of "doing history" which differs quite a bit from the broad practice of "doing science." Yet there's something interesting to consider here. Professor R.W. Davies said the following about E.H. Carr's thoughts:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It is evident that Carr had come to the conclusion that the relativity of scientific knowledge was greater than he had previously suggested. Time and place exert great influence on the theory and practice of the natural scientist. <strong>The interplay between hypothesis and concrete material in natural science closely resembles the interplay between generalization and fact in history.</strong> Valid scientific hypotheses do not necessarily possess the capacity for precise prediction which is often attributed to them; in some natural sciences they closely resemble the generalizations of the historian.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The bolded emphasis is mine. What I take from these thoughts is that while history should not be practiced as if it were "scientific," the idea of how the sciences are practiced can certainly inform our musings about, and research into, history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lee Smolin in his book <em>Einstein's Unfinished Revolution: The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum</em> said something that brings these thoughts together for me:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To have a scientific mind is to respect the consensus facts, which are the resolution of generations of dispute, while maintaining an open mind about the still unknown. It helps to have a humble sense of the essential mystery of the world, for the aspects that are known become even more mysterious when we examine them further. The more we know, the more curious it all is.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This, to me, very much sounds like a style of thinking we can apply to the context of a historian. So perhaps it's not so much that history "is like" science but rather that doing history "is like" practicing the scientific method. And if that's the case &mdash; and I do believe it is &mdash; then there is perhaps a logic that we can apply to being a historian and practicing historical thinking.
      </p>

      <h2>A Logic of Historical Thought</h2>

      <p>
        There's a play from 1980 called "Translations" by Brian Friel and one part of it always stuck with me, which is shown in the following dialogue:
      </p>

      <pre>
        Owen: What is happening?

        Yolland: I'm not sure. But I'm concerned about my part in it. It's an eviction of sorts.

        Owen: We're making a six-inch map of the country. Is there something sinister in that?

        Yolland: Not in...

        Owen: And we're taking place names that are riddled with confusion and...

        Yolland: Who's confused? Are the people confused?

        Owen: And we're standardising those names as accurately and as sensitively as we can.

        Yolland: Something is being eroded.
      </pre>

      <p>
        The context here is that Owen comes to a certain small Irish town with a group of Royal Engineers. Their job is to map the Irish countryside. As part of this project, Owen helps this group "anglicize" the Irish town names. Yolland, however, who is one of the engineers, ends up becoming extremely interested in Irish culture and believes that the work being done is an act of destruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In one sense the play is about the relationship between language and culture and I risk drastically simplifying the play by focusing on just one aspect here. That aspect is the erosion of a particular culture by the way it's talked about but also in terms of what's done to it, particularly by those who are part of the culture. In the words of Yolland, I do believe something is being consistently eroded with the discipline of history, particularly when it comes to the gaming context that I'm going to be focusing on and even for the wider computing context.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just to put a little meat behind that last statement, a lot of the history of computing gets wrapped up in Silicon Valley or focused on either Apple or Microsoft. But there's a lot of history showing that very interesting things were going on all over the United States and with many different companies. It's also the case that a lot of the history of gaming gets swamped under large milestone games, like say <em>Adventure</em> or <em>Ultima</em>, without taking into account the many preceding games that show paths of development.
      </p>

      <p>
        The history gets eroded and, bringing in some of my thoughts from earlier, this is because the history gets sanitized and streamlined. The messiness and the "mushy" bits and the "ugly" parts get plastered over with a more anodyne view of how things developed.
      </p>

      <p>
        My thoughts here are perhaps summed up well by Stephen Toulmin in his book <em>The Uses of Argument</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To think up new and better methods of arguing in any field is to make a major advance, not just in logic, but in the substantive field itself.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In fact, this reminded me of something else I read in Max Weber's <em>On the Methodology of the Social Sciences</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The poor condition of the logical analysis of history is shown by the fact that neither historians, nor methodologists of history, but rather representatives of very unrelated disciplines have conducted the authoritative investigations into this important question.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I can't speak for the wider venue of historical thought but I can say that in the historical research done into gaming and computing there are a lot of fans and/or academics from other disciplines attmempting their hand at history. This idea is brought up a bit in Jon Peterson's book <em>The Elusive Shift: How Role-Playing Games Forged Their Identity</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Academics eventually began exploring the theory of role-playing games ... but practitioners have never entirely relinquished their claim on this endeavor.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In this context, Peterson brings up the thoughts of Evan Torner who made a distinction between "para-academics" and "aca-fans." The history of gaming is full of people on both sides of that spectrum but I think it's often been the case that, to use Weber's phrase, it's the "representatives of very unrelated disciplines" that actually have more to say in a way that avoids the erosion problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think there's two reasons for that. One is that people from the unrelated disciplines are better able to use a logic to their historical approach because of their relative distance to the subject matter. They approach gaming and computing as historians first; not as gamers or computer scientists looking to write some history. I also think such people are more willing to look at previous historical errors rather than just repeating existing accounts of history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along these same lines, another idea that resonated with me was that of Alan Simpson from <em>The Wealth of the Gentry</em> where he said:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Our present state of knowledge is one of mitigated ignorance. In such situations, the honest enquirer always has one consolation &mdash; his blunders may be as instructive as his successes.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I came upon that reference as I was re-reading David Hackett Fischer's <em>Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought</em>, which talks about the mistakes people make in their thinking. The idea of the blunders was interesting to me. Fischer's book in particular has been a huge influence on me and you'll note his subtitle is the title of this section. On that point, Fischer says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Assuming that [a] logic of historical thought does tacitly exist, the next question is how to raise it to the level of consciousness.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Notice we're back to a historical consciousness here? That's largely been my focus as well, but in the gaming context in particular &mdash; which I've long been fascinated with &mdash; and the wider computing context in which it's situated. As far as a method to the madness, Fischer continues:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        If there is a tacit logic of historical inquiry, then one might hope to find a tacit illogic as well, which reveals itself in the form of explicit historical errors. On this assumption, I have gone looking for errors in historical scholarship, and then for their common denominators, in the form of false organizing assumptions and false procedures.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So there it is: instead of finding the logic of historical thought by looking at the cases of it being practiced, instead look at the cases of it <em>not</em> being practiced and work from that. And this brings to mind the words of Willard Van Orman Quine in <em>Methods of Logic</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Truths are as plentiful as falsehoods, since each falsehood admits of a negation which is true.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        But why do this? Why take this particular methodological approach? Well, again going with Fischer's idea:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        First, [a classification of errors] may clearly indicate a few mistaken practices that are not sufficiently recognized as such. Second, [the classification of errors] might operate as a heuristic device for the discovery of a few constructive rules of reason.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        One of our challenges here is that there are a near infinity of wrong ways to do things but there's usually no single right way. There are, instead, a plurality of right ways. Yet it's also a truism that of those infinity of wrong ways, we tend to see only a finite number of them actually occur with any sort of regularity. So we can reduce the scope of the investigation in that sense. We thus have a plurality of right and wrong ways to consider and perhaps to contrast each other with.
      </p>

      <p>
        That point also speaks to a wider goal: it's not just to look at the errors we tend to commit as part of our historical discipline, but rather the ways we start to (often gradually) slide into error. Our slippery slopes can be so gradual that we barely notice slipping into error and thus we have the gradual, perhaps barely noticeable, degradation of our evidentiary standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a discipline that requires experimental verification, you might be able to course correct for some of that degradation to keep yourself honest. But this is less the case in a discipline that relies more on the implausification that I talked about earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to be clear that what I'm advocating here isn't a clarion call for logic at all costs and a "scientific" approach to looking at gaming in the context of history. Rather, as Fischer says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Though logic can distinguish error from truth and truth from truism, it cannot distinguish a profound truth from a petty one. A good many historical arguments are objectionable not because they are fallacious but because they are banal, shallow, or trivial. As a remedy for these failings, logic is impotent.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Okay, so logic by itself may not work as well in a situation where implausification is more important than confirmation and falsification. Yet the notion of the scientific method, or at least thinking somewhat scientifically in that sense, presumably still makes sense. Here I find myself going back to something that Karl Popper said in <em>Conjectures and Refutations</em>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The way in which knowledge progresses, and especially our scientific knowledge, is by unjustified (and unjustifiable) anticipations, by guesses, by tentative solutions to our problems, by conjectures. These conjectures are controlled by criticism; that is, by attempted refutations, which include critical tests.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        When reading that statement, it's worth keeping in mind the words of Sabine Hossenfelder I mentioned earlier, regarding the lack of utlility of falsification as a guiding principle. But here we're led away from falsification as some idea to "prove something wrong" and rather we just focus on how to put our ideas to the test. The quality of the test we can put our ideas to &mdash; how much we can historically figure out &mdash; perhaps is what guides us along the spectrum of plausible to implausible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think <em>that</em> idea is broadly applicable to the humanities and the sciences. I think <em>that</em> way of framing our thinking applies not just to how we do our work as putative historians, but also how we think about our work; how we test our own assumptions and biases in terms of our historical discipline &mdash; how we practice it as well as how we promote it. So I think it's really important to keep in mind the idea of "conjecture" from Popper. This is not something that is amenable to or enhanced by any sort of logical analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm about to tie all this together with the ecological approach I started with. Going back to John Lewis Gaddis, in <em>The Landscape of History</em>, he says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        History as a discipline is the means by which a culture sees beyond the limits of its own senses. It's the basis, across time, space, and scale, for a wider view.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Indeed, a wider view. And thus shades of the ecological approach talked about earlier. But that wider view has another meaning as well, I believe. To that point, John Dalberg-Acton (sometimes better known just as Lord Acton), speaking about history, said this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        History is not only a particular branch of knowledge, but a particular mode and method of knowledge in other branches.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        And that "other branches" bit in turn goes back to that idea of people in other disciplines having just as much to say about history as those who might be rooted in those disciplines.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some ways, I think Dalberg-Acton's point is very much the calling of history, as it were. This is a point I will come back to later. For now I'll say that history, as a discipline, is rooted in storytelling, narrative and experimentation. Thus historical thinking is a mode of thought and being that has existed since humans began to reason about their place in the world and the artifacts they create and leave behind in that world. Here's one more thought from Fischer:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        To argue that there is a tacit logic of historical thinking is to assert that every historical project is a cluster of constituent purposes, and that each of these purposes imposes its own logical requirements upon a thinker who adopts them. Whether the purpose at hand is to design a proper question, or to select a responsive set of factual answers, or to verify their factuality, or to form them into a statistical generalization which itself becomes a fact, or whatever &mdash; it always involves the making of purposive and procedural assumptions that entail certain logical consequences. Every historian must learn to live within the limits which his own freely chosen assumptions impose upon him.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I very much believe we have to look at history as that "cluster of constituent purposes." The logical requirements of those purposes demands a distinction between actual historian and someone who is just, say, chronicling. Speaking specifically to the gaming context, we've had a lot of chroniclers, but not so many actual historians. We've also had a lot of conflating of those two terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Gaming and the Human Element of History</h2>

      <p>
        If we're taking a historical point of view, we have to be aware of various freely chosen assumptions that we make. We have to be able to consistently, and persuasively, articulate the logical consequences of those assumptions. And, perhaps most importantly, we have to learn how to live within the limits of certain very constrained assumptions that we impose upon ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Somewhere around 1932 Albert Einstein said:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Science as something already in existence, already completed, is the most objective, most impersonal thing that we humans know. Science as something coming into being, as a goal, however, is just as subjectively, psychologically conditioned, as all other human endeavors.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The reason I find that quote interesting is because it brings to the forefront the idea that there's a notion of "work being done" versus "work that is being verified." There's an interplay of the objective and subjective there that I find extremely interesting as these are two polarities we often have to jump between.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was reminded of the above quote while reading the book <em>Einstein and the Quantum</em> by A. Douglas Stone. In this book Stone asserts that when learning physics it's often the case that the "history that is mentioned is sanitized to eliminate the passions, egos, and human frailties" of the physicists of the past. The point being that many people simply want to get to the science parts, without worrying necessarily about the human element that makes the "science parts" possible. Continuing on from that point, Stone says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        After all, since physical science (we believe) is a cumulative discipline, why shouldn't we downplay or even censor the missteps and misunderstandings of our predecessors?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The idea here being that it's the outputs of the discipline that ultimately matter, not necessarily the many false starts that got us to where we are. Whereas, instead, I would argue that our blunders are <em>exactly</em> one of the things we should be studying more of, which reinforces a point I stated earlier. Continuing along this idea, which I should note, Mr. Stone is actually arguing <em>against</em>, he says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Wouldn't telling the real human history of discovery just confuse people?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Or, would it, in fact, make the discoveries themselves <em>more</em> discoverable and understandable &mdash; maybe even relatable! &mdash; by considering how they are the output of human creativity and innovation? I want to note again here that the author is actually arguing <em>against</em> the viewpoint and this was based on an epiphany he had. But I had the exact opposite feeling towards the epiphany.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, first, what is that epiphany? Putting it simply, just about everything is in the past &mdash; and the most interesting parts of the past &mdash; are how people interacted in it. We often have the outputs of history but we can't recapture the <em>exact</em> history as it happened. Unlike most science, history is not a repeatable experiment. But we can, however, <em>represent</em> history. And we can fit our representations to the reality we encounter.
      </p>

      <p>
        That last point is crucial to what I'm working on now &mdash; a history of ludic concerns. This, however, requires a broad view of what historians do. The discipline of history is often taken to be much simpler than it is. In fact, historians are often asked why social scientists don't simply just do the job of the historian. The simple answer to that is that this approach has failed. I haven't rigorously set out to prove that here but I hope some of my above thoughts, and references, get you thinking along those lines.

      <h2>The Legibility of History</h2>

      <p>
        There is a distinct aspect to any discipline that suggests you can make something "legible." But what does that actually mean?
      </p>

      <p>
        What this notion of "legibility" means is that you make something measurable and hence manipulable. This is how we attempt to impose and maintain authority, and thus control, over something. So we preserve the past by making it legible and retrievable and we presume to do this for the present, which then lays out a roadmap for the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that sounds a little deterministic, right? Let's keep in mind that fallacy of retrospective determinism! This search for legibility is, in many ways, an imposition of general uniformity. And that tends to diminish local diversity. Keep in mind Yolland's concerns in the play! Anything universally applied tends to submerge localized knowledge of how things actually work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus the imposition of any sort of methodology like this risks the imposition of uniformity which is distinct from unification and, thus, it seems to have us fall into the reductionist rather than ecological viewpoint.
      </p>

      <p>
        What this shows us is that attempts to make history "legible" tend to fall into the same traps as when we try to make history "scientific."
      </p>

      <h2>History is Like Cartography</h2>

      <p>
        Just about everything discoverable for us is in the past. That's the case on any area you choose to tackle, regardless of what method or approach you use. The future is coming into being but it's doing so on the back of the past. And that past keeps growing and growing. So quite literally everything we rely on is in the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the very moment of "now" became the past just as you read this. As the future gets here, it becomes the "now" and &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; moves into the past. So while the people we study may design and build games for the future, all that work immediately becomes part of the load-bearing struts of the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since most of everything is in the past this means that what we study &mdash; or, rather, the history of it &mdash; is necessarily a <em>representation</em> of reality. This is very similar to cartography.
      </p>

      <p>
        What do maps do? Well, let's think about how they great created. They get created by humans. So maps essentially distill the experience of others for the purpose of helping you understand a particular terrain. Maps help you get from where you are to where you want to go. Maps thus serve as a way to package up a vicarious experience by providing a representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cartographers are people who create maps and it's very much a discipline. Further, it's a discipline that shares a lot with those who practice history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">coastline paradox</a>. This paradox is often stated in the context of Lewis Richardson's "how long is the coastline of Britain?" question.
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is that there is no answer or, at least, not just one answer. The answer is contextual.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea of the "paradox" being that the further down you go in your scale of measurement, the more irregularities of coastline you will encounter. This means that the length of coastline you measure can expand (or contract) in relation to the way that you're measuring it. Yet, of course, the actual <em>reality</em> of the coastline is not changing, right? After all, the coastline <em>is</em> there. So what does is paradox telling us?
      </p>

      <p>
        It means that we can choose to precisely delineate but we can also choose to generalize and abstract. This is how we create a representation of truth. But a key point that often gets left off is that our particular mode of representation determines whatever it is that we're representing.
      </p>

      <p>
        How we choose to measure or deal with something is important and impacts what we're measuring. This is very much like &mdash; note: "is like," not "is" &mdash; the famous uncertainty principle in physics: the act of observation alters what's being observed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus here I seem to be suggesting that history perhaps is something we measure &mdash; and thus make legible &mdash; and that it <em>does</em> perhaps have some corollaries with science.
