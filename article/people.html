      <h1>Keeping People in Computing</h1>

      <p>
        The idea of people being front-and-center of computation, and thus technology, once held sway but has often been in danger from a wider technocracy. Here I want to focus on what "people's computing" in the broad strokes was.
      </p>

      <h2>An Implied Ontology</h2>

      <p>
        The concept of "people's computing" as an implied ontology, rather than a concrete historical era, introduces a specific perspective. Ontologically, it suggests that the categorization of a specific period as "people's computing" is a construct that we apply retrospectively to encapsulate a set of shared values, practices, and attitudes.
      </p>

      <p>
        By acknowledging the constructed nature of this era, I mean to explicitly highlight the interpretive aspect of historical demarcation. It's not a predefined, objectively existing period, but rather a lens through which we choose to view and define a particular slice of time. This approach aligns with the understanding that historical narratives are shaped by the storytellers, and the identification of distinct eras involves a certain level of subjectivity and interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        So my emphasis on the implied ontology is hopefully prompting my readers to consider the fluidity of historical categorizations and the importance of recognizing our role in shaping the narrative. What I hope is that this provides a nuanced perspective that encourages a critical reflection on how we conceptualize and frame historical periods, particularly in the realm of technology and computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus on "people's computing" and the shift from a time when individuals were at the forefront of computation to the potential overshadowing by a broader technocracy is, I hope, a compelling and relevant narrative thread. It speaks to the changing dynamics in the relationship between people and technology over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The notion of "people's computing" &mdash; during the 1964 to 1975 period &mdash; championed by groups like the People's Computer Center and figures like Bob Albrecht, serves as a poignant reminder of a time when the democratization of technology was a driving force. It reflects a period when individuals, particularly students, were actively engaged in computing, using tools like BASIC to demystify and make technology accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        My intention to delve into what "people's computing" was in broad strokes is meant to suggest an exploration of the ethos and principles that characterized this era. My hope is that this approach not only captures a historical moment but also sets the stage for reflecting on the implications of a potential shift towards a more technocratic perspective.
