          The focus in this article is not on any specific games but rather on the broader historical context in which games, and gaming, came to be situated in a technology context, specifically that of computing.

        <h2>A Basis in Experimentation ...</h2>

        <p>
          Exploring the early days of computing and game development is like peering into the wild west of technology. In the nascent stages, hobbyists &mdash; armed with programming languages like BASIC &mdash; were somewhat similar to pioneers in uncharted territory.
        </p>

        <p>
          These early game developers weren't just coding; they were conducting experiments, pushing the limits of the available technology to see what it could do.

        <p>
          It was a fusion of creativity and curiosity, where every line of code was a step into the unknown. Much like scientists in a lab, they were learning by doing, discovering the capabilities and constraints of the hardware as they went along.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crucially, these games weren't just entertainment; they were manifestations of the evolving relationship between humans and machines, each line of code a small triumph in the ongoing saga of technological discovery. It was a time when the boundaries of possibility were drawn by the imaginations of those who dared to experiment with the digital frontier.

        <h2>... But a Focus on Computation</h2>

        <p>
          Arguably <em>computer</em> science should have been called <em>computing</em> science. Or, at the very least, perhaps there should have been a shift to that terminology as the technology evolved more beyond the hardware itself and into what the software that was running on that hardware actually did.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I say "computation," please understand that this isn't just about the mechanics of programming or coding. It's about computational design, the latest incarnation of which is most manifested in applications of artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a matter of interest, artificial intelligence actually grew up with the idea of technology-based gaming and continues to be used in that context today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Computation has always been, and still is, what transforms the design of our products and services. This is the intersection of humans and technology, an area that's always fascinated me. Design has always determined how humanizing or dehumanizing that intersection is. One of the ways that computing was always most humanized was when it focused on simulations and games.
