        The history of computing presents an intriguing landscape, offering a plethora of theoretical and historiographical frameworks that can be effectively employed. This inherent diversity adds a layer of fascination to the subject, as it is intricately interwoven with key historical developments spanning the late 19th and 20th centuries, encompassing technical, social, economic, and political facets. In essence, it stands as a subject of paramount significance not only for specialists in the history of technology but also for a myriad of scholars across diverse disciplines.
      </p>

      <p>
        The richness of the history of computing extends its relevance to social and cultural historians, economists, business historians, management theorists, labor historians, sociologists of professions, organizational theorists, and computer scientists alike. This breadth underscores its role as a focal point for interdisciplinary exploration, drawing scholars from various fields to unravel the multifaceted tapestry of its evolution and impact on the broader historical landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recent scholarship in the history of technology has unveiled a profound and enduring insight: technological change is not solely propelled by inherent technological imperatives but is equally shaped by intricate social processes. This realization challenges the notion of a singular, ideal trajectory for technological evolution. Instead, technologies emerge as solutions crafted for specific problems, tailored to specific users, within distinct temporal and spatial contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crux lies in how certain problems are defined as requiring solutions, which users are prioritized in the design process, what considerations are given to other technological systems, and who holds the authority to establish technical and economic priorities. These are fundamentally social considerations that intricately mold the trajectory of technological development. In essence, the evolution of technology is a dynamic interplay between technical functionalities and the social forces that navigate the complex terrain of problem-solving, user needs, and overarching societal priorities.

        In this 1996 book <em>The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America</em> Paul Edwards says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Historiography is always guided by specific tropes, genres, and plot structures. These are what enable any narrative to achieve its sense of coherence—its sense of "being a story" and therefore of embodying a possible truth. The favored tropes and plots of any given history reflect the perspective of the historian and influence how material is deemed relevant.

        This research is undertaken with a historian's eye for the past and a media scholar's acuity of the present.

        The book <em>Playback - A Genealogy of 1980s British Videogames</em> by Alex Wade states that the problems with many expositions of videogame history is that they are "only <em>temporally</em> correct and, even then, only within the strict linear-chronology demanded by technological progression and development."
      </p>

      <p>
        One suggestion is that any such linear-chronological approach could be replaced by one more focused on genealogy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alex says that it's not true to say that certain important temporal and spatial histories "have been abridged from the literature" but, rather, in his view, these histories "are lying dormant, occasionally shaken from their slumber by investigators working at the geographical margins and cultural peripheries of games studies."

        In his 1983 book <em>Shared Fantasy: Role-Playing Games as Social Worlds</em> Gary Alan Fine says:

      <blockquote>
        Sociologists who study leisure typically find themselves attacked on two fronts. First, they are accused of not being sufficiently serious about their scholarly pursuits. Second, they are accused of alchemically transforming that which is inherently fascinating into something as dull as survey research computer tapes.

        It's basically an argument of either "you're having too much fun with your work" or "your work is stealing our fun."

        When the reigning film theory was a form of semiology inspired by Ferdinand de Saussure's <em>Course in General Linguistics</em> published in 1916. Christian Metz was the leading proponent of this mode of theorizing in film in his <em>Essais sur la signification au cinéma</em> published in 1968.
      </p>

      <p>
        This took over from auteurism and the theory of realism propounded by André Bazin. Saussurean linguistics actually seemed to make things a little more "scientific" in nature.

        In <em>Mystifying Movies: Fads & Fallacies in Contempoary Film Theory</em>, author Noël Carroll says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The reception of contemporary film theory in America is an epicycle within a larger historical process which involves the rapid expansion of film studies as an academic field of study in the seventies. This expansion, in turn, seems initially to have been a response to a resurgence of interest in film in the sixties, marked, in part, by the rediscovery and reaffirmation of the masterpieces of the Hollywood cinema.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I don't think we really have contemporary game theory but I do think there's a larger historical process in which games studies happen, particular when there's a desire for so called "retro-gaming" perspectives. With the pace of development in computing technology and gaming, "retro" is a rapidly shifting and amorphous term, at best. Here the "masterpieces of the Hollywood cinema" would more refer to games that, retrospectively, were seen to be largely influential. It's not that they were necessarily the first of their kind or even the best of their kind; but rather simply one of their kind that, for whatever reason, had an outsized effect.

        Just about every theatrical film throughout history (with some notable exceptions) is made up of many different pieces of film joined together into a mosaic of images. This is essentially the basis behind the "cut." A cut is an abrupt, but usually trivial film transition from one sequence to another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cuts are used in film to bring us from one image to the next. Unlike dissolves, cuts are instantaneous transitions; so as to say they don't occur gradually. A cut represents a total and instantaneous displacement of one field of vision with another.
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth of the matter is that film is actually being "cut" twenty-four times a second. Each frame is a displacement from the previous one - it is just that in a continuous shot, the space/time displacement from frame to frame is small enough (twenty milliseconds) for the audience to see it as motion within a context rather than as twenty-four different contexts a second.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, when the visual displacement is great enough (as at the moment of the cut), we are forced to re-evaluate the new image as a different context: miraculously, most of the time we have no problem in doing this.
      </p>

      <p>
        What we <em>do</em> seem to have difficulty accepting are the kind of displacements that are neither subtle nor total: Cutting from a full-figure master shot, for instance, to a slightly tighter shot that frames the actors from the ankles up. The new shot in this case is different enough to signal that <em>something</em> has changed, but not different enough to make us re-evaluate its context: The displacement of the image is neither motion nor change of context, and the collision of these two ideas produces a mental jarring - a jump - that is comparatively disturbing.
