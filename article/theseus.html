      <h1>The Theseus of Gaming</h1>

      <p>
        My original thought was to frame this article as "The Ontology of Gaming," but, while writing it, the <em></em>Ship of Theseus</em> came to mind. This was a thought experiment around the metaphysics of identity and it seemed quite apropos. I was also going to title this article "The Identity of Gaming" but the subject was a little more broad than just that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before looking at Theseus and his ship, let's actually consider some gaming history.
      </p>

      <h2>The Initial Identity of Games</h2>

      <p>
        As the microcomputer revolution started up and progressed from, say, 1977 to 1984, there were certain categories of games that served to frame identities. Those games were ultimately growing out of what, at the time, was a tradition of text-based games that were finding their own identity. Those earlier text-based games started to be called things like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>simulation game</li>
        <li>participation novel</li>
        <li>electronic novel</li>
        <li>compunovels</li>
        <li>interactive fiction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The name that stuck the most, and still does, is "text adventures." The idea of the textual adventure was interesting because it allowed for a distinct identity when technology improved and "graphical adventures" started to come on the scene. What we ended up with as the early microcomputer years wore on were certain categories.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>There was the textual adventure.</li>
        <li>There was the graphical adventure.</li>
        <li>There was the computer role-playing game (CRPG) adventure.</li>
        <li>There was the action adventure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notice how everything is an "adventure." I suppose you could frame that as a core identity, but then I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. So instead of focusing on "adventure," let's focus on that "graphical" part for a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we had something like <em>Zork 1</em>:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-zork-1.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Zork I text interface.">

      <p>
        And you had a CRPG like <em>Ultima 1</em>:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-ultima-1.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Ultima 1 CRPG graphic interface.">

      <p>
        And you had an action game like <em>Karateka</em>:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-karateka.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Karateka action graphic interface.">

      <p>
        Notice something there? The CRPG and the action games also used graphics. But the CRPG tended to focus on strategy and tactics, usually around a team of characters where there's a heavy reliance of statistics-driven combat. The action adventure tended to focus more on reflex-oriented activities, such as jumping around platforms or using combinations of "moves" to fight enemies.
      </p>

      <p>
        So the point is: why is "graphical adventure" slotted out on its own? That's not really a distinct identity, right? In fact, certain textual adventures could show graphical pictures, such as <em>Mystery House</em>:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-mystery-house.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Mystery House text interface with graphics.">

      <p>
        Or <em>Oo-Topos</em>:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-oo-topos.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Oo-Topos text interface with graphics.">

      <p>
        Yet the inclusion of visuals didn't make them graphical adventures in their identity. But why not? Well, the "true" graphical adventures replaced descriptive text with pictures and a textual interface (usually a parser) with a joystick or mouse. With the graphical adventures relying more on the mouse, they also came to be called "point-and-click adventures." Something like <em>Maniac Mansion</em> is a good example:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-maniac-mansion.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="Maniac Mansion graphic interface.">

      <p>
        Here there wasn't a parser but notice those keywords at the bottom that you selected. Effectively you would build a command to interact with the game world by clicking on words as opposed to typing them into a parser mechanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, then again, you had something like <em>King's Quest 1</em> which combined text and graphics and didn't really rely on the "point-and-click" interface so much, at lesat in terms of the keywords:
      </p>

      <img src="../images/history/theseus-kings-quest-1.jpg" width="610" height="383" alt="King's Quest 1 graphic interface.">

      <p>
        Here the game did provide an actual command prompt at the bottom that allowed you to type in game commands but also allowing for fluid control of the character within the game interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what was the common element? What was the <em>identity</em>?
      </p>

      <h2>The Evolving Identity of Games</h2>

      <p>
        There was a common identity that could be framed around gameplay &mdash; not so much the game mechanics, but rather with the ways the games played out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here this meant (usually) dealing with puzzle-solving and exploration. But more than that, the focus was on the emphasis on story. There was a coherent storyline or narrative arc that went beyond just a set of quests and certainly well beyond doing nothing more than learning a set of mechanics.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're starting to get into definitions and definitions can be tricky. Jimmy Maher, also known as "The Digital Antiquarian", tackled this subject a bit in his post <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/ludic-narrative-nee-storygame/">Ludic Narrative n√©e Storygame</a>. That post started me thinking on this and I made a few comments there to that effect. So my content here certainly owes a debt of gratitude to Jimmy's. More specifically, Jimmy brings up four framing points to make up the identity of what he considers a "ludic narrative":
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The work must be directly and obviously interactive.</li>
        <li>A computational simulation (a "storyworld") must enable that narrative.</li>
        <li>The player must play the role of an individual (a distinct persona) in the storyworld.</li>
        <li>There must be a coherent story arc and it must be possible to complete that story.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We don't have to get into what games, or kinds of games, the above may or may not disqualify as that would require delving into a lot of gaming history. That said, in terms of looking at the above list at least a little bit, consider that some of the above games had you taking on the role of a nameless person involved in some story, even if the story was a bit threadbare.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Zork</em> had you essentially exploring the ruins of a kingdom with the sole aim being to find a certain number of treasures.</li>
        <li><em>Mystery House</em> had you exploring a more restricted domain &mdash; literally just a house &mdash; and rather than treasures, you found clues to determine the identity of a killer.</li>
        <li><em>Oo-Topos</em> ups the stakes a bit: you have to escape imprisonment on a planet so that you can deliver something that will literally save the human race from extinction.</li>
        <li><em>Karateka</em> has the anonymous hero ascending a mountain into the fortress of a villain named Akuma to rescue Princess Mariko.</li>
        <li><em>Ultima 1</em> has you trying to stop the evil wizard Mondain after being hired by Lord British to find some way to circumvent the wizard's immortality before he destroys and/or enslaves a continent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All nameless adventurers undertaking some quest within the context of an overarching story. What you explore may be different &mdash; a house, a prison, a mountain fortress, an underground dungeon &mdash; but the basic idea is the same. In addition to that dynamic, some of the games focused on very specific characters or even multiple characters.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>King's Quest 1</em> has you play as Sir Graham who is sent on a quest by King Edward to save the Kingdom of Daventry by finding three legendary treasures.</li>
        <li><em>Maniac Mansion</em> has you initially play as Dave Miller who, along with friends that you can also play as, must rescue his girlfriend, Santy Pantz, from a mad scientist named Fred Edison and, along the way thwart an effort to take over the world.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notice how those games all share a few themes and motifs (collecting certain treasures), usually saving something (world, continent) or someone (a captive). So, is that the <em>identity</em>? Is that what makes these "adventure games"?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, notice that the "plot" of <em>Karateka</em> was basically replicated much earlier by <em>Donkey Kong</em>, with the hero (at least given a name, "Jumpman", only later to become Mario) trying to rescue the "damsel in distress", who was known as Pauline. So does this mean <em>Donkey Kong</em> is just as much an "adventure game"?
