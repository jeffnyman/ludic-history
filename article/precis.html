      <h1>A Ludic Historian Précis</h1>

      <p>
        I refer to this content as my Ludic Historian series. But what does that actually mean? Great question! Here I'll break that title down a little bit and give a feel for what this is all about.

      <h2>Starting a Ludic History</h2>

      <p>
        Starting a Ludic History requires me to consider both "ludic" and "history." In short, Ludic Historian is going to be about looking at the history of games and, within that broad context, a focus on computer games in particular and, even more particularly, on video games. That's simple enough but let's dig down a little deeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Delving deeper into the realm of a ludic history involves more than just exploring the evolution of games; it's a journey into the very essence of human interaction, creativity, and technological advancement. In this series, while there is a focus on the more culturally relevant video games, I will try to unravel the intricate tapestry of play, from ancient games etched into the sands of time to the pixelated landscapes of modern video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a narrative that I believe transcends mere entertainment, weaving together threads of culture, psychology, and innovation. As we navigate the labyrinth of what I call Ludic History, I want to examine the societal shifts reflected in game design, the technological leaps that propelled gaming into new areas of interaction, and the intangible yet profound impact of games on the human experience. Every game is a portal to a chapter in the vast book of human playfulness.
      </p>

      <h2>The Focus on Ludic</h2>

      <p>
        The term <em>ludic</em> derives from <em>ludus</em>, meaning "play." This is a term that's useful in connection with games and, more broadly, rules of play.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><em>ludic</em></strong><br>
          <em>adjective</em><br>
          of, relating to, or characterized by play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><em>ludically</em></strong><br>
          <em>adverb</em><br>
          in a ludic or playful manner.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What the term "ludic" does is take us into so-called "game studies." There are two broad approaches taken to analyzing video games in this context, which are ludology and narratology.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ludology</strong> focuses on the ludic structure of games, by which is meant the design of a game, the mechanics, and the dynamics. Essentially how the game plays <em>as a game</em> and how that gameplay influences players.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Narratology</strong> is concerned with narrative structures of some experience, like films and video games, and understanding how those structures influence the intended audience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There's an interesting intersection of how narrative became ever more sophisticated in the context of ludic experiences and my plan is to cover that history here as and when appropriate.
